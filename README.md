# Classification of Reviews as Positive or Negative
This project used machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression) to classify reviews as positive or negative. The project also fine-tuned a BERT model for classification. Additionally, it applied topic detection using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify common themes in the reviews.
