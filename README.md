# Classifying_reviews_as_positive_or_negative
This project used machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression) to classify reviews as positive or negative. The project also fine-tuned a BERT model for classification. Additionally, it applied topic detection using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify common themes in the reviews.
